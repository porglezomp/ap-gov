<p><strong>Government</strong> — an organization which makes policies and enforces them</p>

<p><strong>Citizen</strong> — a member of a nation or political system, with all the rights and responsibilites of that system</p>

<p><strong>Politics</strong> — the process by which decisions are made in a government</p>

<p><strong>Monarchy</strong> — a system in which a single person rules a country in the interest of the common good</p>

<p><strong>Totalitarianism</strong> — a system in which a single person rules a country in their own interest</p>

<p><strong>Oligarchy</strong> — a system in which a small group of only the powerful and wealthy have control of the government</p>

<p><strong>Democracy</strong> — a system in which the people have control of the government</p>

<h3 id="section-1">2)</h3>
<p>Locke was optimistic, and thought people were naturally good an corrupted by society. He believed government’s job was to protect people’s natural rights. Hobbes thought that people were naturally chaotic, and that they needed a strong government in order to keep them in line.
Locke’s idea of the social contract was basically simply that a government made an agreement with the people. The people agree to support the government as long as the government protects their rights, and their consent gives the government its legitimacy.
The colonies declared independence because they felt that England was violating their social contract, and the Constitution is packed full of the idea.</p>
