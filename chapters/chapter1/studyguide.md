Locke was optimistic, and thought people were naturally good an corrupted by society. He believed government's job was to protect people's natural rights. Hobbes thought that people were naturally chaotic, and that they needed a strong government in order to keep them in line.
Locke's idea of the social contract was basically simply that a government made an agreement with the people. The people agree to support the government as long as the government protects their rights, and their consent gives the government its legitimacy.
The colonies declared independence because they felt that England was violating their social contract, and the Constitution is packed full of the idea.
