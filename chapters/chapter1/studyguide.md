### 1)
**Government** --- an organization which makes policies and enforces them

**Citizen** --- a member of a nation or political system, with all the rights and responsibilites of that system

**Politics** --- the process by which decisions are made in a government

**Monarchy** --- a system in which a single person rules a country in the interest of the common good

**Totalitarianism** --- a system in which a single person rules a country in their own interest

**Oligarchy** --- a system in which a small group of only the powerful and wealthy have control of the government

**Democracy** --- a system in which the people have control of the government

### 2)
Locke was optimistic, and thought people were naturally good and corrupted by society. He believed government's job was to protect people's natural rights. 

Hobbes thought that people were naturally chaotic, and that they needed a strong government in order to keep them in line.

Locke's idea of the social contract was basically simply that a government made an agreement with the people. The people agree to support the government as long as the government protects their rights, and their consent gives the government its legitimacy.
The colonies declared independence because they felt that England was violating their social contract, and the Constitution is packed full of the idea.

### 3)
**Direct democracy** --- the people all have a chance to directly vote on issues and contribute to the lawmaking process

**Indirect democracy** --- people elect representatives who then vote on issues and legislate for them

**Republic** --- another word for **indirect democracy**

### 4)
**Political culture** is the collective set of commonly held political values and concepts about how a government should be run.
America's political cultures is based on:

- Personal Libery
- Equality
- Popular Consent
- Majority Rule
- Popular Sovereignty
- Civil Society
- Individualism
- Religious Freedom

### 5)
**Personal liberty** --- what the constitution guarantees, and what the government is meant to protect.

**Political equality** --- "All men are created equal," said the Declaration of Independence, and then we're still working on it now. It's one of the goals of our political system --- equal opportunities.

**Popular consent** --- also "consent of the governed," basis for our government's power, this consent is expressed through voting.

**Majority rule** --- manifested in the Supreme Court, Congress, and all public elections. It's a basic facet of democracy.

**Popular sovereignty** --- the idea that the ultimate authority in society is with the people, it's shown as an element of democracy and of federalism, and arguably is produced through voting.

**Natural law** --- American government tries to follow the basic principles of "natural law" outlined in the constitution and follow morals.

**Civil society** --- political literacy is necessary for informed voters, and activism is necessary to get things done. Civil society promotes both of these.

**Individualism** --- in the same way that we're capitalist, we focus on bettering ourselves. Individualism shaped U.S. expansion, and is still central to the American dream. It's why we're scared of socialism.

Currently, I feel that equality is the most driving of our politics, since most of the big issues in congress are over equality-ish things. Liberals are asking for freedoms and equality for gays, women, and more, and those things are advancing slowly right now.

### 6)
Politicals ideology is
> A unified set of beliefs about the purpose and scope of government, held by groups or individuals.

Ideologies can:

- Help _explain_ why political conditions are how they are.
- People use their ideology to _evaluate_ decisions. Your choices mirror your beliefs. You vote for people whose beliefs mirror your own.
- _Orientation_ --- for many people their ideology can be part of their identity. They may have ideologies based on the fact that they're female, or Black, or many other different identites.

### 7)

#### **Conservatives**
Generally pro small-government, don't want change. They prefer less regulation and prefer local government to federal government. They generally believe that social problems aren't the purview of the government.

**Social conservatives** are highly religious conservatives.

#### **Liberals**
Want change, they generally value equality very highly. Support good welfare programs, and other programs of the Federal government helping individuals.

#### **Libertarians**
Don't want government interference, want a free market.

These labels are generally don't fit individuals very well, because most people have opinions per-issue, and they're not necessarily consistantly conservative or liberal about things.

### 8)
Demographics are the characteristics of the population as a whole. It includes things like race and ethnicicty.
