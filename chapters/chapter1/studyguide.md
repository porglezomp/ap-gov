Locke was optimistic, and thought people were naturally good and corrupted by society. He believed government's job was to protect people's natural rights. 

Hobbes thought that people were naturally chaotic, and that they needed a strong government in order to keep them in line.

Locke's idea of the social contract was basically simply that a government made an agreement with the people. The people agree to support the government as long as the government protects their rights, and their consent gives the government its legitimacy.
The colonies declared independence because they felt that England was violating their social contract, and the Constitution is packed full of the idea.

### 5)
**Personal liberty** --- what the constitution guarantees, and what the government is meant to protect.

**Political equality** --- "All men are created equal," said the Declaration of Independence, and then we're still working on it now. It's one of the goals of our political system --- equal opportunities.

**Popular consent** --- also "consent of the governed," basis for our government's power, this consent is expressed through voting.

**Majority rule** --- manifested in the Supreme Court, Congress, and all public elections. It's a basic facet of democracy.

**Popular sovereignty** --- the idea that the ultimate authority in society is with the people, it's shown as an element of democracy and of federalism, and arguably is produced through voting.

**Natural law** --- American government tries to follow the basic principles of "natural law" outlined in the constitution and follow morals.

**Civil society** --- political literacy is necessary for informed voters, and activism is necessary to get things done. Civil society promotes both of these.

**Individualism** --- in the same way that we're capitalist, we focus on bettering ourselves. Individualism shaped U.S. expansion, and is still central to the American dream. It's why we're scared of socialism.
